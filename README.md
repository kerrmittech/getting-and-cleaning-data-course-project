Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R script (run_analysis.R), the code book (CodeBook.md) and the resulting data (tidy_data_set.txt) for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning Data" project, available in Coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in a folder named 'UCI HAR Dataset' within your working directory, uncompressed and without names altered.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analysis that is described in the 5 steps. The script can be launched in RStudio.

The output of the run_analysis script is called `tidy_data_set.txt`.
